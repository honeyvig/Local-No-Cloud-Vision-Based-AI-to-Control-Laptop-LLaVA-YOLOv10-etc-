# Local-No-Cloud-Vision-Based-AI-to-Control-Laptop-LLaVA-YOLOv10-etc
design a complete, local, vision-based AI solution to automate interactions with my laptop. The goal is to have an AI system that can visually analyze the laptop’s screen in real-time (via a video splitter and capture device), understand the displayed interface (menus, buttons, text), and execute commands (mouse clicks, keyboard input) through a microcontroller connected to the laptop’s USB port. Everything should operate offline, with no cloud involvement, and no additional software installed on the laptop itself.

I - Project Details:

A. Local Video Capture:

- The laptop remains untouched, with no software installation.

- A video splitter will duplicate the laptop’s display output.

- One output goes to the usual laptop display, the other output goes into a capture device connected to a secondary machine (Raspberry Pi or mini-PC).

B. Local Vision AI (Inspired by GPT Vision):

- On the Raspberry Pi (or mini-PC), deploy an AI model to analyze the captured video feed in real-time (such as YOLOv10, etc.)

- Utilize open-source models (computer vision, OCR, and possibly a multimodal model like LLaVA, BLIP-2, or OpenFlamingo) to recognize UI elements, read on-screen text, and identify icons or buttons.

- The AI must run entirely offline using downloaded open-source models. No data should be transmitted externally.

C. Natural Language Interaction:

- I should be able to give instructions to the AI (via text or voice) such as: “Click on the Start button ” or “Open the search bar and type ‘cmd’.”, double-click on Word and write the document with using this template, etc.

- The AI will interpret these instructions, identify the correct on-screen element, and determine the coordinates for the action.

D. Controlling the Laptop via a HID Microcontroller:

- A microcontroller (Arduino, Teensy, or similar) connected via USB to the laptop will emulate a standard mouse and keyboard.

- The Raspberry Pi sends commands to the microcontroller (e.g., via USB serial) to move the mouse, click, or type text, without installing any software on the laptop.

II - Deliverables:

A. Recommendations for hardware (video splitter, capture card, Raspberry Pi/mini-PC, HID-enabled microcontroller).

B. Detailed instructions for setup, wiring, and configuration.

C. Source code or scripts to:

- Capture the video stream and analyze it with the AI model.

- Integrate a Vision+Language model (open-source) to understand natural language instructions and the on-screen interface.

- Translate identified actions into HID commands for the microcontroller.

D. Documentation for usage, demonstration of feasibility, and initial support.
===========
To build a complete, local, vision-based AI solution for automating interactions with your laptop, we’ll break it down into key components, each with a corresponding Python code or explanation.
Key Components:

    Local Video Capture: Capturing the laptop screen using a video splitter and a capture card.
    Local Vision AI (Computer Vision): Analyzing the screen content in real-time using AI models like YOLO, OCR, and possibly multimodal models like LLaVA, BLIP-2, etc.
    Natural Language Interaction: Enabling natural language processing (NLP) for interaction.
    HID Microcontroller Control: Sending control commands to a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino or Teensy) via USB to perform actions like mouse clicks and keyboard input.

I. Hardware Recommendations

    Video Splitter: A basic HDMI or VGA splitter will duplicate the output of the laptop's display. Ensure it supports the resolution of your laptop screen.

    Capture Card: A USB capture card, such as an Elgato Cam Link or similar, will capture the HDMI output from the video splitter.

    Raspberry Pi/Mini-PC: A Raspberry Pi 4 or any mini-PC with sufficient processing power for real-time AI analysis would work well. Preferably 4GB of RAM or more.

    Microcontroller: Arduino (with HID capabilities) or Teensy, connected via USB to emulate mouse/keyboard input.

II. Python Code and Implementation

We will go through each step required for your vision-based AI solution.
Step 1: Video Capture from Display

First, we’ll need a script to capture the video stream from the capture card. This can be done with OpenCV, which supports real-time video capture.

pip install opencv-python numpy

import cv2
import numpy as np

# Initialize the capture device (video capture card connected to the Raspberry Pi)
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Device index may vary based on your setup

if not cap.isOpened():
    print("Error: Could not access capture device.")
    exit()

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Show the captured frame
    cv2.imshow('Screen Capture', frame)

    # Press 'q' to quit the loop
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Step 2: Vision-based AI for UI Element Detection

Next, you’ll want to use an object detection model (like YOLOv10 or a similar model) to detect UI elements like buttons and text.
a) Download and Load the YOLO Model

Use the YOLOv5 or YOLOv7 model for object detection, or use any other suitable vision model. Here, we’ll use a simple example with YOLOv5.

pip install torch torchvision
pip install yolov5

import torch
import cv2

# Load YOLOv5 model (this model is available offline)
model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s')  # 'yolov5s' is the small model

# Process captured frame and detect objects
def detect_ui_elements(frame):
    results = model(frame)
    results.show()  # Displays the detected objects
    return results

# Capture video and apply detection
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Device index for capture card

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Detect UI elements in the frame
    detect_ui_elements(frame)

    # Display the captured frame
    cv2.imshow("AI Vision Capture", frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

b) Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for Text Detection

Use Tesseract OCR to read text from the captured screen, which will be useful for interpreting menu items or on-screen text.

pip install pytesseract
pip install opencv-python

import pytesseract

# Function to perform OCR on the captured frame
def ocr_text(frame):
    # Convert image to grayscale for better OCR accuracy
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Use Tesseract to extract text
    extracted_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(gray)
    print("Extracted Text:", extracted_text)
    
    return extracted_text

# Capture video and apply OCR
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Perform OCR on the frame
    ocr_text(frame)

    # Display the captured frame
    cv2.imshow("OCR Capture", frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Step 3: Natural Language Interaction for Command Interpretation

To interpret natural language commands like "Click on the Start button," you can use a simple NLP model.

pip install transformers

from transformers import pipeline

# Load a pre-trained NLP model for command processing (e.g., BERT or GPT)
nlp = pipeline("text-classification", model="bert-base-uncased")

# Function to interpret natural language commands
def interpret_command(command):
    result = nlp(command)
    print(f"Command interpretation result: {result}")
    return result

# Example of interpreting a command
command = "Click on the Start button"
interpret_command(command)

Step 4: Controlling the Laptop via HID Microcontroller

You can emulate mouse and keyboard actions using an Arduino or Teensy microcontroller. First, we need to send control signals to the microcontroller via serial communication (USB).

import serial
import time

# Initialize serial communication with the microcontroller
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 9600)  # Serial port for your microcontroller

# Function to send commands to microcontroller (move mouse, click, etc.)
def send_mouse_click(x, y):
    # Sending mouse coordinates and click command via serial communication
    ser.write(f"CLICK {x} {y}".encode())

# Example: Send a click command to the microcontroller
send_mouse_click(200, 150)
time.sleep(1)

For the Arduino side, you can write a simple sketch to interpret the serial commands and control the mouse and keyboard.
III. Final Integration and Offline Operation

By combining the video capture, vision AI, NLP-based command interpretation, and HID microcontroller control, you can create a complete system for automating interactions with your laptop. Ensure all components are running on the Raspberry Pi or mini-PC with no cloud dependencies.
